          Graduate with a very good grade because i am currently a student and
          that is the primary goal.
        </li>
        <li>
          I aim to continuously improve my technical skills, particularly in web
          development and programming languages. I plan to take advanced
          courses, participate in coding challenges, work on personal projects,
          collaborations, certifications and all to solidify my knowledge and
          keep up with industry trends so that i can land a good paying job
        </li>
        <li>
          Beyond technical skills, I want to focus on soft skills such as
          communication, teamwork, and time management. I believe these are
          crucial for personal and professional success because that's another
          important thing in thw tech space necessary for having a good career
        </li>

        <li>
          Enjoy life because life is too short than to just continue to work all
          day, so Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, a balanced
          diet, and mindfulness practices into my routine to ensure overall
          well-being.
